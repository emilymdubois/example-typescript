# example-typescript

An example TypeScript implementation using Webpack.

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Build

```sh
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` directory in project root containing the compiled JavaScript and source mappings. Open the `index.html` file, as it already points to the `dist/main.js` file:

```sh
open index.html
```
